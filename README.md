# graph-playground

The initial idea of the project is to create graphs visualisations and play with path optimisation. The goal of the project is to spike on and explore with visual Javascript means and develop some mathematical engine around it.

Initial plan (that is free to be changed on the way, as the main goal is only to learn and to explore):
 - [ ] Create a graph with n vertices randomly distributed across the view, (?) define logic for edges
 - [ ] Be able to calculate a route between two selected vertices, area around this route
 - [ ] Be able to find the optimal route

 Technologies to be used:
  - CSS, HTML
  - Javascript, canvas for visualisation
  - Testing: jest, (?) something else for visual testing
